I designed and built this Damper in order to minimize my worries about breathing molten plastic fumes while 3D printing, i'm using an air dryer hose to vent the fumes outside through a window.
After assembly you'll have a fully automated air-flow damper, with a very easy integration to Octopi using MQTT (with a manual control via push button as well).
The design is based on an earlier simpler design that was directly connected to my Octopi's GPIO's and I decided that it was too cumbersome.

Besides the printed parts, I used these parts (all cheap):

Stepper motor with driver (28BYJ-48 5V DC)
Push button
RGB Led
Wemos D1 mini

I'll add more details about the assembly and Octopi configuration in the future.
